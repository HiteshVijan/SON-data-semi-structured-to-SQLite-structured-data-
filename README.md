# JSON-data-semi-structured-to-SQLite-structured-data-

Objective: Convert JSON data(semi-structured) to SQLite (structured data ) with proper metadata specification. And then write SQL Queries to find insights to set up a new business. 

Overview: In this project, you will work as a team to convert data from Yelp.com, available on Kaggle as JSON files, and convert them into tables with appropriate metadata, and store them in SQLite database. You will use only one platform Kaggle for this, and will not require Google Collab or AWS services. 

Now for the Business Value from this exercise: You want to set up a new restaurant, and you have yelp data. Write 10 queries on the yelp data which help you find answers to questions that will help you start a new restaurant in a city of your choice.  

For instance, you can either use ratings or reviews as a basis for deciding which city could need a new restaurant. Similarly, you could decide on the cuisine based on feedback or already existing restaurants, using a combination of the business and and review tables.
